If you have only one speaker on a recording, confirming this will keep the platform from looking for other speakers. Depending on the length and language of the audio, processing should take between 5-15 minutes on a Mac device (longer on a PC) Once completed, you should have timestamps, generic speaker names (Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc.) and dialogue Example of Premiere Transcript output in Google Sheets Editing and Exporting Transcripts While Adobe Sensei is one of the better transcription models we’ve tested, you will run into errors depending on the quality of the recording and the similarity of the speaker’s voices One of the handy things about editing your transcripts in Premiere is that playback follows the text in the Transcript window, so it is a smoother workflow than coordinating with the audio player in one window and the transcript text in another To edit the speaker names (which default to Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc.) select the ellipses to the left of the dialogue, edit or add additional speakers To edit the dialogue, simply double click whichever passage need configuring While cleaning up dialogue is easy to do in Premiere, if you need to combine dialogue sections or create new fields, these will need to be done in a spreadsheet or document To export, click the ellipses on the Text window, find Export and choose either CSV for a spreadsheet or TXT for a document Creating Captions First, select the CC Create Captions button in the Transcript window This will open a Create Captions module that will have some options for formatting, spacing and how many lines you would like the captions to display as This will create a caption track, displayed above the video track on the timeline. To adjust the font, size and area that the captions will be displayed, select the entire track of dialogue in the timeline, then select Window from the top menu, then Workspaces, then Captioning and Graphics. To add a translated caption, select the Caption Translation button, then configure the correct source language as well as what you would like the language to be translated to Finally, adjust the positioning of the captions so they don’t overlap. In this case, I have configured both caption tracks to display in two lines. By adjusting the Set Vertical Position of the Spanish language track to -60.00, this lifts the text up over the English language while still being generally oriented at the bottom of the display. Setting this to -30.00 should work if you chose to have captions generate in a single line display. To export these captions, select Export from the top left. Within this menu you can adjust your file name, export destination, and choose to export as a video, audio, gif or image file in the Format section (default will be mp4, which is a solid, lower file size option). When you have everything configured, select the Export function in the lower right hand corner. &#10042; ________ ╭──────╮ / \\ / \\ | | | ╭──╮ | | TRANSCRIPT| | │CC│ | | ----- | | ╰──╯ | | ( •‿^ ) | | ( ^‿• ) | | &lt; &gt; | | l l | \\_________/ \\ | | / / \\ \\______/ /_____\\ / | \\ | | /____|____\\ (b) (b) (b) (b) That's it!

        "text": "At the library, we have been working together to make sure our digital collections and main site meet the technical standards of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 and part of those efforts has been to make sure all of our video and audio files have transcripts. This is beneficial not only for our patrons using screen readers but also for all of our patrons to make oral history recordings keyword searchable. The following steps will guide you through how to generate a transcript of either audio or video files using Adobe Premiere. This will also describe how to edit and export these files or turn your transcripts into captions. A Note for Students: Adobe Suite, which includes Premiere, is listed as being available on the student lab computers on the second floor of the library. Premiere is also available in the digital editing station of the studio, which can be reserved here . If students want to access Premiere through their devices, they need to be enrolled in a course where the software is required, and they can do that through this OIT student software request form.
